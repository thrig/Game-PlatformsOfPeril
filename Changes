        * The management wishes to apologize for the previous changelog
          message; those responsible have been summarily sacked.
        * Improve bomb animation by first moving the bomb (or monster)
          into the monster (or bomb) and only then animating that cell.
          (My budget for special effects is obviously not very large.)

        Some internals fiddling. Animate explosions.

0.04    2019-08-17
        Altscreen support, more portable GetTerminalSize call.

0.03    2019-06-06
        Add 'x' command to examine level. Change bomb and make bomb keys
        to make them harder to press. More level maps.

        Better ensure minimum terminal size of 70x24. Better handle
        demise of animates. Install level maps with module. move_nop()
        causes monsters to track player. Also some level maps. And now
        the monsters are always tracking-happy murder bots. Fix totally
        broken level changing code.

0.01    2019-06-03
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
